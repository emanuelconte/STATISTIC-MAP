# COVID-19 Statistical Dashboard  

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our planet for over two years. This application is a global COVID-19 dashboard that allows users to select a country on the map and view case statistics, as well as interactive charts displaying case and death trends over time.  

## Features  

- 🌍 Interactive world map with country selection  
- 📊 Real-time COVID-19 case and death statistics  
- 📈 Dynamic charts showing historical trends  
- 📱 Responsive design for optimal viewing on any device  

## Technologies  

- **COVID-19 API**: [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)  
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Next.js  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Data Visualization**: ApexCharts (react-apexcharts)  
- **Maps**: Leaflet (react-leaflet)  
- **State Management**: Jotai  
- **Data Fetching**: React Query  

## Key Learnings  

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  

- **Jotai**: A state management solution that uses atoms as independent state units, simplifying global state management.  
- **Data Visualization**: Implemented dynamic charts and interactive maps to display COVID-19 trends.  
- **TypeScript**: Improved type safety by defining interfaces and types for API responses and application state.  
- **API Integration**: Efficient data fetching and caching using React Query.
